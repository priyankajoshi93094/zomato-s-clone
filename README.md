🍽️ Zomato Clone - Frontend Development with HTML & CSS

Excited to share my Zomato Clone Project, built entirely using HTML and CSS! This project reflects my passion for creating visually appealing and user-friendly web designs.

Highlights of the Project
✅ Clean Layout: Replicates the structure of a food delivery platform.
🎨 Responsive Design: Ensures smooth browsing on different screen sizes.
✨ Interactive UI: Hover effects and visually engaging restaurant cards.
📍 Categorized Sections: Dining, Delivery, and Nightlife tabs designed for clarity.

This project allowed me to sharpen my skills in HTML structure and CSS styling, with a focus on replicating real-world applications. It’s a step toward mastering frontend web development!
